A branch points to a specified version (or 'reality' if you will) of the project that you are working on. UsinAWhen you create a branch, you are effectively taking two 'snapshots' of the projects you are working on.; you can then move  into the new branch and commit to it seperately. WheDevelopers use branches to work on new concepts & features or small incremental changes; when ready, they can choose to merge the branch into their master branch, or leave it as a seperate version.
