A branch points to a specified version (or 'reality' if you will) of the project that you are working on. Using git, you can create alternative versions (alternative realities) of the same project wby using brnaches. Each branch has a seperate timeline from the other branches and can be used to store defined lines of conceptual development or small incremental changes that are related to the larger project.
